2. **API Access Authentication** → **ALREADY WORKING**
   - Public endpoints configured for frontend access
   - Authentication only required for CMS admin functions

3. **Data Loading Priority** → **ALREADY WORKING**  
   - Frontend hooks prioritize API data over static files
   - Proper fallback mechanisms in place

4. **Test Reliability Issues** → **IMPROVED**
   - Enhanced login helpers with retry mechanisms
   - Better element selectors to avoid strict mode violations
   - Improved save change detection
